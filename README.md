######How it works.

The main idea is to divide all expenses into two groups: regular ones (such as rental fee, tax, insurance which are fixed in long term) and all others. Also all other expenses are divided into different parts and called envelopes. For example there are such envelopes as "food and household", "wishlist", "clothes", "unplanned expenses" etc.

Thus my native language is Russian, currently app is in Russian, however internationalization is in the progress
